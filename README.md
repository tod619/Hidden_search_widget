# Hidden_search_widget

## Description

A hidden widget that is revealed when the user clicks on the search icon. On the first click an input field is revealed, and when the user clicks on the search icon again the input field is hidden. An eventListner is used with the toggle method to add and remove an active class to the page elements and transition effects are used to create smooth animations in the CSS.
